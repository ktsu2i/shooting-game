git clone https://github.com/ktsu2i/shooting-game.git
```

Go to the cloned project.

### 2. Install Python

Python 3 should be already installed in Mac.

Then, run this following command and check if you installed it successfully.

```
python --version
```

e.g.
```
Python 3.9.6

### 3. Set up for a virtual environment

If you work on multiple projects in Python, package version conflicts could happen, so it is essential to create a virtual environment for each project to avoid any unexpected errors.

It comes with the built-in package called `venv` in Python 3.3 or later.

#### Create a virtual environment. 

You can name it whatever you want.

```
python -m venv [env name]
or
python3 -m venv [env name]
```

For Mac

```
. [env name]/bin/activate
```

For Windows

```
.\[env name]\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Pygame

```
pip install pygame
```

### 5. Run the code

```
python main.py
or
python3 main.py
```

### 6. Deactivate a virtual environment

```
deactivate
```
